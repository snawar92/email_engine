# EmailEngine

:postbox: Send and track emails at scale with Rails and Redis

You get:

- A history of emails sent to each user
- Open and click tracking
- Easy UTM tagging

Works with any STMP provider but has built in Amazon SES callbacks.

# In Development. Subject to Change

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'email_engine'
```

Generate and modify the initializer:

```ruby
rails generate email_engine:install
```

## How It Works

The tracking of email headers, content, open and click counts are all handled in Redis.

Every email has a unique Message Token, which is applied to the email header as "EMAIL-ENGINE-ID".  Open, click and unsubscribe links use that Message Token to track usage, and stats are generated.

An admin provides the ability to monitor email performance.
